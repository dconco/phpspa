## Performance: HTML Compression

To ensure your application is as fast as possible, PhpSPA includes a powerful, built-in HTML compressor. It automatically minifies your final HTML output by removing whitespace, comments, and other unnecessary characters, which reduces the page size and leads to faster load times. âš¡

By default, PhpSPA tries to auto-detect the best settings. However, you can take full control for fine-tuned performance.

-----

### Environment-Based Configuration (Recommended)

The easiest way to manage compression is to set the application's environment. PhpSPA will then apply a sensible preset for you.

  * `development`: Compression is disabled to make debugging easier.
  * `production`: A high level of compression is enabled for maximum performance.

<!-- end list -->

```php
<?php
use phpSPA\App;
use phpSPA\Compression\Compressor;

$app = new App($layout);

// Set the environment to automatically configure compression
$app->compressionEnvironment(Compressor::ENV_PRODUCTION);
```

-----

### Manual Compression Control

For more granular control, you can manually set the compression level and enable or disable Gzip.

There are several levels available, from basic to extreme.

```php
<?php
use phpSPA\App;
use phpSPA\Compression\Compressor;

$app = new App($layout);

// Manually set the highest level of compression and enable Gzip
$app->compression(Compressor::LEVEL_EXTREME, true);
```

#### Available Levels:

  * **`Compressor::LEVEL_NONE`**: No compression is applied.
  * **`Compressor::LEVEL_BASIC`**: Removes comments and basic whitespace.
  * **`Compressor::LEVEL_AGGRESSIVE`**: Performs more intense whitespace removal.
  * **`Compressor::LEVEL_EXTREME`**: Applies the most aggressive minification for the smallest possible file size.
