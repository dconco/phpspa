## Core Concepts: App & Component

Everything in `phpspa` revolves around two main classes: `App` and `Component`.

* `App`: This is the main container for your entire application. It holds your layout and manages all your components.
* `Component`: This is a reusable piece of your UI. Think of it as a simple PHP function that outputs HTML.

You create one `App` instance, create your `Component`s, and then attach them to the app.

### Here's how they work together:

```php
<?php

use PhpSPA\App;
use PhpSPA\Component;

// 1. Define a layout. It must have a `body()` function.
$Layout = function () {
   return body(); // This is where your component's content will be rendered.
};

// 2. Create the main application instance with your layout.
$app = new App($Layout);

// 3. Create a component. It's just a function that returns HTML.
$homePage = new Component(function () {
   return "<h1>Welcome to the Home Page!</h1>";
});

// 4. Configure the component (e.g., set its route).
$homePage->route('/');

// 5. Attach the component to the app.
$app->attach($homePage);

// 6. Run the application to render the page.
$app->run();
```



==========================================


## The Layout

Your Layout is the main HTML shell that wraps your entire application. It's where you define your `<html>` document, the `<head>` section, and any global scripts or styles.

A layout has a simple rule:

1.  **Provide a target element.** This is where your components will be rendered. A common & default choice is `<div id="app"></div>`.

### Example Layout (`/layout.php`):

This file simply returns a function that outputs your HTML structure.

```php
<?php

return fn () => <<<HTML
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
      <head>
         <title>My Awesome App</title>
      </head>
      <body>
         <div id="app"></div>
      </body>
   </html>
HTML;
```

You then pass this layout directly to your `App` when you create it.

```php
<?php

use PhpSPA\App;

// Load the layout file
$layout = require __DIR__ . '/layout.php';

// Initialize the app with the layout
$app = new App($layout);
```

Now, all components attached to your app will be rendered inside that `<div id="app"></div>`.
