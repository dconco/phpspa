# Managing Styles & Scripts ðŸŽ¨

<style>
code { background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(102, 126, 234, 0.1), rgba(118, 75, 162, 0.1)); padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 3px; }
</style>

PhpSPA offers a powerful way to manage your CSS and JavaScript. You can write them directly in PHP, and the library will automatically serve them as optimized, cache-busting external files for maximum performance.

!!! info "Asset Management"
    PhpSPA automatically generates versioned, cacheable asset files for optimal performance.

## Global Assets

For styles and scripts that apply to your entire site, attach them directly to your `$app` instance.

The methods `styleSheet()` and `script()` accept a callable that returns your raw code. For better organization, it's recommended to keep this code in separate files.

**Example (`styles/GlobalStyle.php`):**

```php
<?php
// returns a callable with your CSS code
return fn () => <<<CSS
   body {
      background-color: #f8f9fa;
      font-family: sans-serif;
   }
CSS;
```

**Example (`index.php`):**

```php
<?php
$app = new App($layout);

// Attach the global style and script from their files
$app->styleSheet(require 'styles/GlobalStyle.php', 'global-styles');
$app->script(require 'scripts/GlobalScript.php', 'global-scripts');
```

!!! tip "Cache-Busting"
    Behind the scenes, PhpSPA creates unique, versioned links like `/phpspa/assets/global-styles-a1b2c3d4.css`, which allows the browser to cache them effectively. The optional second parameter (`'global-styles'`) is a name added to the file for easier debugging.

## Component-Specific Assets

You also have two ways to add assets that only belong to a specific component.

=== "Method Chaining (Cached)"

    This works just like global assets. The code is served in its own cached file.

    ```php
    <?php
    $profileComponent = new Component(fn() => '<div>...</div>');

    $profileComponent
       ->route('/profile')
       ->styleSheet(fn() => '.profile-card { border: 1px solid #ccc; }');
    ```

=== "Inline Tags (Uncached)"

    For very small, component-specific tweaks, you can write standard `<style>` and `<script>` tags directly inside your component's `heredoc` string.

    ```php
    <?php
    function UserProfile() {
       return <<<HTML
          <style>
             /* This style is not served as a separate cached file */
             .profile-card {
                padding: 20px;
             }
          </style>

          <div class="profile-card">
             <h2>User Profile</h2>
          </div>
       HTML;
    }
    ```

!!! warning "Inline Assets"
    **Important:** This is the simplest method, but these inline assets **will not be externally cached** by the browser. It's best reserved for small, non-critical snippets.
