# Performance: HTML Compression

To ensure your application is as fast as possible, PhpSPA includes a powerful, built-in HTML compressor. It automatically minifies your final HTML output by removing whitespace, comments, and other unnecessary characters, which reduces the page size and leads to faster load times. âš¡

!!! info "Auto-Detection"
    By default, PhpSPA tries to auto-detect the best settings. However, you can take full control for fine-tuned performance.

## Automatic Compression (Default Behavior)

PhpSPA automatically initializes the HTML compressor when you create your `App` instance. The second parameter controls this behavior and is set to `true` by default.

```php
<?php
use PhpSPA\App;

// Auto-initialization is enabled by default
$app = new App($layout);

// This is the same as:
$app = new App($layout, true);
```

!!! success "Smart Detection"
    When auto-initialization is enabled, PhpSPA automatically detects the best compression level based on your server environment. You don't need to manually configure anything!

### Disabling Auto-Initialization

If you want full manual control over compression, you can disable auto-initialization:

```php
<?php
use PhpSPA\App;

// Disable auto-initialization
$app = new App($layout, false);

// Now you must manually configure compression if you want it
$app->compression(Compressor::LEVEL_AGGRESSIVE, true);
```

!!! tip "When to Disable"
    Disable auto-initialization only if you need precise control over compression settings for specific use cases.

## Environment-Based Configuration (Recommended)

The easiest way to manage compression is to set the application's environment. PhpSPA will then apply a sensible preset for you.

=== "development"

    Compression is disabled to make debugging easier.

    ```php
    <?php
    use PhpSPA\Compression\Compressor;

    $app->compressionEnvironment(Compressor::ENV_DEVELOPMENT);
    ```

=== "production"

    A high level of compression is enabled for maximum performance.

    ```php
    <?php
    use PhpSPA\Compression\Compressor;

    $app->compressionEnvironment(Compressor::ENV_PRODUCTION);
    ```

!!! tip "Environment Presets"
    Set the environment to automatically configure compression with sensible defaults.

## Manual Compression Control

For more granular control, you can manually set the compression level and enable or disable Gzip.

```php
<?php
use PhpSPA\App;
use PhpSPA\Compression\Compressor;

$app = new App($layout);

// Manually set the highest level of compression and enable Gzip
$app->compression(Compressor::LEVEL_EXTREME, true);
```

!!! success "Compression Levels"
    There are several levels available, from basic to extreme:
    
    - **`Compressor::LEVEL_NONE`**: No compression is applied
    - **`Compressor::LEVEL_BASIC`**: Removes comments and basic whitespace
    - **`Compressor::LEVEL_AGGRESSIVE`**: Performs more intense whitespace removal
    - **`Compressor::LEVEL_EXTREME`**: Applies the most aggressive minification for the smallest possible file size
