## Programmatic Navigation with `<Navigate />`

While `<Component.Link />` is perfect for user-driven navigation, you'll sometimes need to redirect a user automatically based on some logic (e.g., after a form submission).

For this, use the `<Component.Navigate />` component. When `phpspa` renders this component, it triggers an immediate, client-side redirect without a full page reload.

-----

### Basic Usage

Simply render the component with a `path` prop. The redirect will happen as soon as the component is added to the page.

```php
<?php
use phpSPA\Http\Request;

function LoginPage(Request $request) {
    $isLoggedIn = false;
    if ($request->isMethod('POST')) {
        // ... validate user credentials ...
        if ($credentialsAreValid) {
            $isLoggedIn = true;
        }
    }

    // Conditionally render the Navigate component or the login form
    if ($isLoggedIn) {
        return '<Component.Navigate path="/dashboard" />';
    }

    return <<<HTML
        <form method="POST">
            ...
        </form>
    HTML;
}
```

### Controlling Browser History

The `Maps` component takes a `state` prop to control how it interacts with the browser's history.

  * `state="push"` (Default): Adds a new entry to the browser's history. The user can click the "back" button to return to the previous page.
  * `state="replace"`: Replaces the current page in the browser's history. This is ideal for post-login redirects, as it prevents the user from clicking "back" to see the login form again.

<!-- end list -->

```php
<?php
// Inside your component logic...

if ($isLoggedIn) {
    // Replace the login page in history so the user can't go back.
    return '<Component.Navigate path="/dashboard" state="replace" />';
}
```
